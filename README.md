# ioSelect
A customisable replacement for the &lt;select&gt; element. Yes, another one.

## Why?

Because I was fed up of trying other libraries and finding that they didn't work the way I wanted them to.

## What's different about this one?

ioSelect is:

* Small (jQuery version is 9KB minified, <3KB GZIPped)
* Fast -- initialisation is almost instantaneous, even for selects with thousands of options
* Dependency-free - that's right, no need for jQuery (or anything like it)
* Easy to customise (very simple HTML structure, minimal default CSS)

ioSelect also...

* Works inside elements with CSS overflow set (e.g. dialogs/popups)
* Supports select multiple with a visual list
* Offers 'search in list' functionality
* Works well on mobile/touchscreen devices
